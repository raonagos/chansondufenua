## Notes

###

- **Performance** : Let's face it, Rust is blazing fast. Everyone knows it, and we wanted a piece of that action on the server side.
- **Eco-Friendly** : Rust is greener than a salad on Earth Day (or thousand?). It's less hungry for memory and energy, making it the eco-warrior of programming languages as C/C++.
- **Type Safety** : Rust's type system is like a strict teacher who makes sure you write correct code. No more sloppy mistakes !
- **Compiler** : Cargo...cargo !
- **Multi Platform** : Thanks to WebAssembly (WASM), our app can run anywhere, and browsers are becoming its best friends.
- **Fun** : Rust is just plain fun to code in.
